# [Introduction](https://www.cablelabs.com/insights/a-comparative-introduction-to-4g-and-5g-authentication)
3GPP defines an Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol and procedures that support entity authentication, message integrity, and message confidentiality, among other security properties.

The **3GPP AKA protocol is a challenge-and-response authentication protocol based on a symmetric key** shared between a subscriber and a home network. After the mutual authentication between a subscriber and a home network, cryptographic keying materials are derived to protect subsequent communication between a subscriber and a serving network, including both signaling messages and user plane data (e.g., over radio channels).
# 4G Authentication
From an authentication perspective, a cellular network consists of three main components: **UEs**, a **serving network (SN)**, and a **home network (HN)**

Each UE has a universal integrated circuit card (UICC) hosting at least a universal subscriber identity module (USIM) application, which **stores a cryptographic key that is shared with the subscriberâ€™s home network**.
## 4G EPS-AKA
The EPS-AKA is triggered after the UE completes the Radio Resource Control (RRC) procedure with eNodeB and sends an Attach Request message to the MME.

The MME sends an Authentication Request, including **UE identity (i.e., IMSI)** and the serving network identifier, to the HSS located in the home network. The HSS performs cryptographic operations based on the shared secret key, Ki(shared with the UE), to derive one or more authentication vectors (AVs), which are sent back to the MME in an Authentication Response message. An AV consists of an authentication (AUTH) token and an expected authentication response (XAUTH) token, among other data.
