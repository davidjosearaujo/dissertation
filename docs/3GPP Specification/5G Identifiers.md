# 5G NR Global Unique Temporary Identifier (GUTI)
5G Global Unique Temporary Identifier (5G–GUTI) is a core network temporary identifier and allocated by Access and Mobility Management function (AMF) to the UE.

# Subscription Permanent Identifier (SUPI) or IMSI
5G Subscription Permanent Identifier is a **globally unique identifier that is assigned to each subscriber in the 5G system**, which is provisioned in the UDM/UDR. A SUPI is usually a string of 15 decimal digits. The first three digits represent the Mobile Country Code (MCC), the next two or three represent the Mobile Network Code (MNC) identifying the network operator. The remainder represents the Mobile Subscriber identification number (MSIN). It represents the individual user of that particular operator. SUPI is equivalent to IMSI which uniquely identifies the ME, which is a string of 15 digits. It is used only within the 3GPP system. The SUPI must contain the address of the home network in order to enable roaming scenarios. For interworking with the EPC, the SUPI allocated to the UE is based on the IMSI number.

# Subscriber Concealed Identifier (SUCI)
﻿It is a privacy-preserving identifier containing the concealed SUPI. The UE generates a SUCI using an ECIES-based protection scheme with the public key of the Home network that was securely provisioned to the USIM during the USIM registration process. It contains the Scheme-output and additional non-concealed information needed for home network routing and protection scheme usage. It contains protection scheme ID, home network public key ID, home network ID e.g MCC and MNC, the SUCI calculation indication, either USIM or ME calculating the SUCI, based on the home operator’s decision indicated by the USIM, the calculation of the SUCI shall be performed either by the USIM or by the ME.

# Permanent Equipment identifier
A PEI is defined for the 3GPP UE accessing the system. The PEI is the means by which the network identifies the user equipment that is capable of accessing a 3GPP network. The PEI can assume different formats for different UE types and use cases. The UE shall present the PEI to the network together with an indication of the PEI format being used. If the UE supports at least one 3GPP access technology, the UE must be allocated a PEI in the IMEI format. The UE presents the PEI to the network along with an indication of the PEI formats being used. If the UE supports at least one 3GPP access technology, the UE must be allocated a PEI in the IMEI format. In 3GPP Rel-15, the only format supported for the PEI parameter is an IMEI.
