# 6.1.3.31  Policy control for non-3GPP devices connecting behind a UE |R19|
The support of QoS differentiation for non-3GPP devices connecting behind a UE using a Non-3GPP Device Identifier is specified in [clause 5.52 of TS 23.501](https://www.tech-invite.com/3m23/toc/tinv-3gpp-23-501_zzd.html#e-5-52).

The SMF may receive from the UE the Non-3GPP Device Identifier and the corresponding user plane address if the UE initiated the PDU session modification procedure, as specified in [clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502](https://www.tech-invite.com/3m23/toc/tinv-3gpp-23-502_p.html#e-4-3-3-2). The SMF sends the Non-3GPP Device Identifier and the user plane address of the non-3GPP device to the PCF. At reception of the Non-3GPP Device Identifier and user plane address, the PCF creates PCC rule(s) considering the Non-3GPP Device Identifier. The PCF determines QoS parameters in the PCC rule(s) based on the Non-3GPP Device Identifier Information retrieved from the UDR and/or based on operator policy. The PCF installs the PCC rules at the SMF to enable QoS handling of the traffic to/from the non-3GPP device behind the UE.

If the Non-3GPP Device Identifier is not present within the Non-3GPP Device Identifier Information as specified in [clause 5.2.12.2.1 of TS 23.502](https://www.tech-invite.com/3m23/toc/tinv-3gpp-23-502_zzzj.html#e-5-2-12-2-1) for the UE, then the PCF indicates to the SMF that the corresponding Non-3GPP Device Identifier is not available for the UE. In case of PDU Session Modification (i.e. SMF contacted PCF via SM policy association modification), the PCF shall reject SM Policy Association Modification and based on the rejection received, SMF shall reject the PDU Session Modification with a cause code to notify the UE that the Non-3GPP Device Identifier is not available for the UE.

If the Non-3GPP Device Identifier is removed from the UE subscription, the UDR notifies to the PCF via Nudr_DM_Notify service of removal of N3GPP device (as defined in [clauses 4.15.6.7.2](https://www.tech-invite.com/3m23/toc/tinv-3gpp-23-502_zz.html#e-4-15-6-7-2) and [4.15.6.15](https://www.tech-invite.com/3m23/toc/tinv-3gpp-23-502_zzb.html#e-4-15-6-15) of [TS 23.502](https://www.tech-invite.com/3m23/tinv-3gpp-23-502.html)). If there is PCC rules associated to the traffic associated to the removed Non-3GPP Device Identifier in a PDU session, the PCF shall remove the PCC rules and start a PCF initiated PDU session modification including a cause indicating that the Non-3GPP Device Identifier is not available.
