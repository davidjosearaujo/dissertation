# 4.3 Security entities in the 5G Core network
The 5G System architecture introduces the following security entities in the 5G Core network:
- **AUSF**: 	AUthentication Server Function;
- **ARPF**: 	Authentication credential Repository and Processing Function;
- **SIDF**:	Subscription Identifier De-concealing Function;
- **SEAF**:    SEcurity Anchor Function.
# 5.2 Requirements on the UE
## 5.2.5 Subscriber privacy
- The UE shall support 5G-GUTI
- The Home Network Public Key shall be stored in the USIM.
- The protection scheme identifier shall be stored in the USIM.
- The Home Network Public Key Identifier shall be stored in the USIM.
- The SUCI calculation indication, either USIM or ME calculating the SUCI, shall be stored in USIM.
# 5.5 Requirements on the AMF
## 5.5.3 Subscriber privacy
- The AMF shall support to trigger primary authentication using the SUCI.
- The AMF shall support assigning 5G-GUTI to the UE.
- The AMF shall support reallocating 5G-GUTI to UE.
# 5.6	Requirements on the SEAF
The security anchor function (SEAF) provides the authentication functionality via the AMF in the serving network. The SEAF shall fulfil the following requirements:
- The SEAF shall support primary authentication using SUCI.
# 5.8	Requirements on the UDM 
## 5.8.1	Generic requirements
The long-term key(s) used for authentication and security association setup purposes shall be protected from physical attacks and shall never leave the secure environment of the UDM/ARPF unprotected.
## 5.8.2	Subscriber privacy related requirements to UDM and SIDF
The SIDF is responsible for de-concealment of the SUCI and shall fulfil the following requirements:
- The SIDF shall be a service offered by UDM.
- The SIDF shall resolve the SUPI from the SUCI based on the protection scheme used to generate the SUCI.

The Home Network Private Key used for subscriber privacy shall be protected from physical attacks in the UDM. 

The UDM shall hold the Home Network Public Key Identifier(s) for the private/public key pair(s) used for subscriber privacy.

The algorithm used for subscriber privacy shall be executed in the secure environment of the UDM.
# 5.8a Requirements on AUSF
The Authentication server function (AUSF) shall handle authentication requests for both, 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
