- **Wireline access Control Plane protocol (W-CP)**: Protocol used to transport AS and NAS signalling between the 5G- RG and the W-AGF over the Y4 reference point. W-CP is specified by BBF and CableLabs. There is no assumption that W-CP refers to only a single protocol or only a specific protocol layer.
- **Wireline access User Plane protocol (W-UP)**: Protocol used to carry PDU Session user plane traffic between the 5G- RG and the W-AGF over the Y4 reference point. W-UP is specified by BBF and CableLabs. There is no assumption that W-UP refers to only a single protocol or only a specific protocol layer.
