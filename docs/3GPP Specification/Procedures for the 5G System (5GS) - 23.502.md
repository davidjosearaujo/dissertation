# 4.2.2 Registration Management procedures
Aspects related to dual registration in 3GPP and non-3GPP access are described in clause [[#4.12|4.12]]. The general Registration call flow in clause [[#4.2.2.2.2 General Registration|4.2.2.2.2]] is also used for the case of registration in 3GPP access when the UE is already registered in a non-3GPP access and vice versa. Registration in 3GPP access when the UE is already registered in a non-3GPP access scenario may require an AMF change, as further detailed in clause 4.12.8.
