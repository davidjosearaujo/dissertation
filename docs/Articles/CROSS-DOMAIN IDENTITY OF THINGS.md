> Typical identity-based decisions that are related to security include device authentication, controlling authorizations (typical authentication, authorization and accounting functions) and the categorization of data. For example, identity- based decisions can be used to ensure that the data returned by an IoT sensor (such as a temperature measurement) is associated with the correct entity (the machine from which the temperature was taken). In general, the routing of input and output data to and from an IoT device is based on identities.

> For humans, sso is a highly valued convenience feature that removes tasks like remembering user login credentials. But for non-human IoT entities, which connect to a rather limited number of services, the use of identities and identity-based decisions in IoT device communication does not necessarily require sso.

 >The security association can then be used for tasks such as authenticating the IoT device before granting access to the service. One promising realization of an identity management solution using `GBA` as a federation technique is a trial project for agricultural applications known as the Connected Vineyards project. gba uses well-known mobile network identity information providers (iips). A uicc/euiccwith a sim application suitable for gba is used in the IoT device, while the corresponding identity information on the mobile network side is provided by the Home Location Register/Home Subscriber Server.

>  The 3gpp identity and gba are currently associated with cellular networks, this technology can also be used for devices connected to a network using other, non-3gpp technologies.
