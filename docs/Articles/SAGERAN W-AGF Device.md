W-AGF(Wireline Access Gateway Function ) is a wired access network function node based on 5G technology, defined by 3GPP and BBF. **It acts as an intermediary between the RG and UPF, supporting N2 and N3 access to 5GC.**

W-AGF is developed on the SageRAN's 5G Engineâ„¢ protocol stack platform and complies with 3GPP standards and the BBF WWC architecture, while adding processing logic for N1(NAS) protocol and SIM card information for network registration.

Additionally, W-AGF includes data routing and forwarding modules for registration and IP data link connections to the 5GC core network, providing standard fixed-mobile convergence network access technology for high-reliability, high-security, and unified authentication.

W-AGF can be widely applied in dedicated network links for industries such as hospitals, banks, campuses, and small and medium enterprises.
