> As the NSA uses both 4G and 5G cellular infrastructure, it needs a much more flexible communication and security protocol for operation and management. In NSA-5G architecture, both the gNodeB and eNodeB are controlled by a common evolved packet core (EPC). This common EPC helps to provide seamless communication between 4G and 5G C-IoT devices. Assignment of both IoT and non-IoT devices (i.e., mobile and cellular, etc.) to the next-generation network needs more complex traffic and data privacy management strategies at the core network.

> Providing efficient D2D or IoT communication over a cellular network platform requires various network entities like user equipment (UE), evolved NodeB (eNodeB), and core networks to be interconnected through various interfaces, either through wires or via a wireless medium.

> Here, the UEs are interconnected via a Wireless LAN (WLAN) with the help of an access point (AP). These APs are interconnected to each other through a base station control by the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network. The information between UEs and APs is exchanged through a dedicated UPlink/Downlink RF connection, whereas the interconnections between eNodeB and are created with the help of X2 interfaces.

> In the NSA C-IoT framework, a LTE infrastructure and EPC network are usually used for end-to-end data transfer and voice communication. The UE/DE is initially connected to a local AP or gateway through WiFi, Bluetooth, or any other short-range network like RFID, LoWPAN, etc. For long-range communication, these devices should be connected through a highly reliable cellular network. The access points (APs) are connected directly to the eNodeB of the LTE and LTE core network.
