> Blockchain technology has the potential to enhance the security and integrity of IoT data in high-speed networks. By leveraging the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain, IoT devices can securely record and share data, ensuring transparency and tamper-resistance. Smart contracts on the blockchain can automate and govern interactions between devices, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data manipulation.
