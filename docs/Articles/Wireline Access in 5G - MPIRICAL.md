The three fundamental pillars of 5G; **eMBB** (Enhanced Mobile Broadband), **MMTC** (Massive Machine Type Communications) and **URLLC** (Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications) clearly emphasizes the importance of Massive IoT and Critical IoT into the overall 5G mix. Furthermore, 5G FWA (Fixed Wireless Access) and 5G as a transport network technology in the backhaul is also being deployed.

5G is based upon a Service Based Architecture incorporating **NFV** (Network Functions Virtualization) and **SDN** (Software Defined Network) technology to drive down the total cost of ownership and to drastically improve network utilization and system elasticity.

**These benefits** are not solely confined to mobile networks and as such, **could also be incorporated by the fixed network or wireline service providers**.
