## 2.2. Authentication and Authorization
>One of the key problems people have when studying authentication and authorization is understanding the difference between the two.

>However, when it comes to federated identity knowing the difference is very important. In fact, federated identity is based on the fact that the two concepts are not the same.
### 2.2.1 Authentication
>Authentication is broken down into two components: identification and verification. Identification occurs before verification. Identification is the process of stating who you are. This statement could be in the form of a username, an e-mail address, or some other method that identifies you.

>Verification is the process that a system goes through to check that you are indeed who you say you are. This is what most people think of when they think of authentication. They donâ€™t realize that the first part of the process is establishing your identity. Verification can be performed in many ways. You supply a password, a Personal Identification Number (PIN), or use some type of biometric identifier.
