# What should I discuss in the "Overall Research Approach" at "Methodology and Proposed Framework" chapter?

## Query
It was constructive. I tried using the existing capabilities and features of 5G to find new solutions to the problem.

The TS documents didn't help much, as they don't quite envision this limitation on the network. Except on the last part I mention, the Connectivity Group Identifiers. Which although they do not explain how they are supposed to be implemented or how do they work, the PDU Session separations were a huge inspiration to my solution

The problem was the fact that wifi-only devices do not have credentials for 5G and thus are incapable of authentication to it, and thus the Core can't recognize them. How could we reference such devices in the overall network? That was the problem
