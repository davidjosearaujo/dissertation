- **Network access security (I)** – security features that enable a user terminal to authenticate and access the network by providing protection on the radio interfaces.
- **Network domain security (II)** - security features that enable network nodes to exchange signalling and user data securely.
- **User domain security (III)** - security features that enable the secure user access to mobile devices.
- **Application domain security (IV)** - security features that enable user and provider domain applications to exchange messages securely. 33.501 specifications do not cover application domain security.
- **Service Based Architecture (SBA) domain security (V)** - a new set of security features that enable network functions of the SBA to communicate securely within serving and other network domains.
- **Visibility and configurability of security (VI)** - security features that enable the user to be informed regarding which security features are in operation or not.

The acronyms used on the above image are as follows: ME=Mobile Equipment, SN=Serving Network, HE=Home environment.
