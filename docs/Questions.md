# What is the problem we are trying to solve?
[[5G and Wi-Fi RAN Convergence#3.6 Support for Wi-Fi Only Devices|Current 3GPP standard does not define architecture to support Wi-Fi only devices without USIM connecting to 5G Core.]]

This is an issue as the architecture expects all UE to support SIM based identity with credentials to connect to the 5GC over WLAN

This imposes a limitation to use cases such as enterprise deployments or IOT, where WiFi-only devices are used and by no having a USIM included, won't be able to connect to the 5G control plane (NAS).
