# Private digital convergence

## Private 5G networks
3GPP describes **non-public networks (NPN)** as being "*intended for the sole use of a private entity such as an enterprise, and may be deployed in a variety of configurations, utilizing both virtual and physical element completely standalone networks, they may be hosted by a **public land mobile network (PLMN)**, or they may be offered as a slice of a PLMN*"

As any 5G system, 5G NPN are composed of:
- **User equipment (UE)**
- 5G **accesses**
	- Consisting of **next-generation NodeB (gNB)** units **connecting UE via a 5G new radio** (5G-NR) wireless interface
- **5G core (5GC)**
## Convergence and 5G
With convergence, private industrial networking continues being a heterogeneous environment, but with common management and operation of all accesses as a single network, via a common 5G control plane and traffic aggregation entities. The 5GC control and data planes have the capability to serve other access technologies. In the scope of private deployments, potential 5GC shared services include:
