# What is the problem we are trying to solve?
>[[5G and Wi-Fi RAN Convergence#3.6 Support for Wi-Fi Only Devices|Current 3GPP standard does not define architecture to support Wi-Fi only devices without USIM connecting to 5G Core.]] *in [[5G and Wi-Fi RAN Convergence.pdf|5G and Wi-Fi RAN Convergence]]* 
# Private digital convergence

## Private 5G networks
3GPP describes **non-public networks (NPN)** as being "*intended for the sole use of a private entity such as an enterprise, and may be deployed in a variety of configurations, utilizing both virtual and physical element completely standalone networks, they may be hosted by a **public land mobile network (PLMN)**, or they may be offered as a slice of a PLMN*"
