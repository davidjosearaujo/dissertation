> To ensure the success of the usage of IoT devices in the network, it is not only sufficient to provide efficient and low-cost connections, but also, it is necessary to be able to provide secure connectivity which is realized through strong authentication and encryption using the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card [2][3]. **Unfortunately, the mentioned security mechanism is limited only towards the authentication, access control and encryption in the mobile network**, since the exchanged messages are delivered to the IoT platform in plaintext by the network

> In order to avoid this predicament, that means, to prevent the lack of security during the message exchange and to have adequate protection in the IoT platform overall, the platform must have its own encryption scheme as well the provisioning of authentication and access control mechanisms just as the SIM provides albeit it can be technic and economically challenging.[[Towards_a_Standardized_Identity_Federation_for_Internet_of_Things_in_5G_Networks.pdf#page=1&selection=138,0,143,36|Towards_a_Standardized_Identity_Federation_for_Internet_of_Things_in_5G_Networks, page 1]]

> Although it fulfills the mentioned purpose, this solution is hindered by the demand of a `GBA` client in every mobile phone, and there is no incentive for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) to implement it. To avoid this, the Eureka Mobicome project proposed some solutions regarding SIM strong authentication, in which strong authentication is provided from a regular browser to a mobile phone that carries a SIM/USIM
