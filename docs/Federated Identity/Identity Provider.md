# [What is an identity provider?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/identity-provider)
An identity provider (IdP) is a system component that provides an end user or internet-connected device with a single set of login credentials that ensures the entity is who or what it says it is across multiple platforms, applications and networks.

A single, consistent identity usable across platforms, applications and networks is called aÂ [federated identity](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/federated-identity-management). An IdP's job is to maintain the federated identity by protecting registered credentials and making them available to disparate directory services through translation services.
# How do identity providers work?
IdPs communicate with each other and other web service providers using languages, such as Security Assertion Markup Language ([SAML](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/SAML)), or data formats, such as Open Authorization ([OAuth](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/OAuth)).

An IdP is responsible for sending three basic types of messages:
1. An **authentication assertion** that shows the requesting device is who or what it claims to be.
2. An **attribution assertion** that passes along all relevant data when a connection request is made.
3. An **authorization assertion** that documents whether the user or requesting device was granted access to the online resource or not.
# Types of identity providers
The **two main types of identity management providers** are **enterprise-based** and **social-based**. An enterprise identity provider is used in a corporate enterprise for identity and access management (IAM) or in personal computing to authenticate users for online activities that take place behind a registration wall, such as online shopping and access to subscription-based content. A social-based IdP allows users to login using social media accounts.
