# [What is an identity provider?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/identity-provider)
An identity provider (IdP) is a system component that provides an end user or internet-connected device with a single set of login credentials that ensures the entity is who or what it says it is across multiple platforms, applications and networks.

A single, consistent identity usable across platforms, applications and networks is called aÂ [federated identity](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/federated-identity-management). An IdP's job is to maintain the federated identity by protecting registered credentials and making them available to disparate directory services through translation services.
# How do identity providers work?
IdPs communicate with each other and other web service providers using languages, such as Security Assertion Markup Language ([SAML](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/SAML)), or data formats, such as Open Authorization ([OAuth](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/OAuth)).
