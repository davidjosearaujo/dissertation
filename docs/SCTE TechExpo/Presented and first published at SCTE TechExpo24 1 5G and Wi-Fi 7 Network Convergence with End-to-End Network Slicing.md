# 3.4 5G-RG configuration scenario defined in 5G R18 specification

> 5G Residential Gateway (5G-RG) can serve as a direct bridge between the 3GPP network and the home network [[WLESS03_Rajamanickam_6573_paper.pdf#page=13&annotation=104R1]]

> A pivotal component of this setup is the Connectivity Group ID, defined on the 5G-RG and corresponding to a distinct physical or virtual port on the gateway.[[WLESS03_Rajamanickam_6573_paper.pdf#page=13&annotation=107R1]]

> The Non-Authenticable Non-3GPP(NAUN3) devices connecting to a particular logical port are considered part of the same Connectivity Group ID[[WLESS03_Rajamanickam_6573_paper.pdf#page=13&annotation=109R]]

> The 5G-RG can be configured by BBF TR069, TR369 and TR181, including the setup of (virtual) port configurations such as VLANs and SSIDs.[[WLESS03_Rajamanickam_6573_paper.pdf#page=13&annotation=116R]]

> These rules dictate how the Connectivity Group ID should be mapped to the parameters of the PDU session [[WLESS03_Rajamanickam_6573_paper.pdf#page=13&annotation=118R]]
