# WWC architecture with AGF

Figure 1 illustrates an FN-RG and a 5G-RG connected to the 5GC through the Access Gateway Function, AGF. W-5GAN comprises of wireline access nodes and an adaption function for 5G convergence, i.e., the AGF. The AGF may be split into control plane, AGF-CP, and user plane, AGF-UP. The **control plane and user plane separation (CUPS)** of the AGF is out of scope of this document and is specified in TR-458.

The user devices (i.e., UE, PC, and STB) access to the 5G Core Network through the 5G-RG or the FN-RG and W-5GAN.

To support an FN-RG, the AGF emulates the N1 interface. The AGF generates and exchanges the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signaling to the AMF on behalf of the FN-RG.
