Figure 1 illustrates an FN-RG and a 5G-RG connected to the 5GC through the Access Gateway Function, AGF. W-5GAN comprises of wireline access nodes and an adaption function for 5G convergence, i.e., the AGF. The AGF may be split into control plane, AGF-CP, and user plane, AGF-UP. The control plane and user plane separation (CUPS) of the AGF is out of scope of this document and is specified in TR-458.
