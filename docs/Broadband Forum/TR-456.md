# WWC architecture with AGF

Figure 1 illustrates an FN-RG and a 5G-RG connected to the 5GC through the Access Gateway Function, AGF. W-5GAN comprises of wireline access nodes and an adaption function for 5G convergence, i.e., the AGF. The AGF may be split into control plane, AGF-CP, and user plane, AGF-UP. The **control plane and user plane separation (CUPS)** of the AGF is out of scope of this document and is specified in TR-458.

The user devices (i.e., UE, PC, and STB) access to the 5G Core Network through the 5G-RG or the FN-RG and W-5GAN.

To support an FN-RG, the AGF emulates the N1 interface. The AGF generates and exchanges the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signaling to the AMF on behalf of the FN-RG.

# 6.1.1 Primary Authentication
In order to access to 5GC, each subscriber is allocated one 5G Subscription Permanent Identifier (SUPI) for use within the 3GPP system.

The SUPI is the permanent identity that identifies the subscriber and it is used only inside the 3GPP system. The SUPI, in respect to the 5G system, **is never provided by UE to the network element, but it is confined to the core network and exchanged between the NF(s) in the core network**. 

The UE in the procedure communicates its Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI). The exception is the case of Emergency Services, where the identification of UE, take precedence over the privacy requirements. TR-470 section 7.5 (SUPI/SUCI for FN-RG) provides additional background information about SUPI and SUCI usage for FN-RG.

# 6.1.2 Additional Authentication
An AGF supporting PPPoE will be configured to require either PAP or CHAP authentication and will negotiate this during LCP procedures.

An AGF in the absence of either an attached RADIUS server or the presence of additional authentication information in RG-LWAC will always treat PAP or CHAP authentication attempts as valid and reply in kind.
