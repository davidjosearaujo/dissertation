# 4.1 AGF architecture
![[Pasted image 20241029153655.png]] The AGF can serve both FN-RG and 5G-RG. Each RG type requires a different AGF control plane (CP) function. Operators utilize a combination of AGF functions to provide different types of broadband converged service(s). The AGF has access, network, and control signal interfaces. The access and network interface are user plane interfaces.

## 4.1.3 AGF Interfaces
The following interfaces are defined in TR-456i2:
- V-interface: The Ethernet interface between the Access Node and the AGF. It is also the interface between the L2TP LAC and the AGF
- V/Y4: Defined in TR-470i2, the interface between an AGF and a wireline access network supporting a 5G-RG.
- V/Y5: Defined in TR-470i2, the interface between an AGF and a wireline access network supporting an FN-RG.
- N1: Defined in 3GPP TS 24.501 as the interface between the 5G-RG and AMF as per 3GPP TS 23.316. In the FN-RG case, it is also a logical interface between the AGF and AMF as per 3GPP TS 23.316
