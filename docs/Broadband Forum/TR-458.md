# 4.1 AGF architecture
![[Pasted image 20241029153655.png]] The AGF can serve both FN-RG and 5G-RG. Each RG type requires a different AGF control plane (CP) function. Operators utilize a combination of AGF functions to provide different types of broadband converged service(s). The AGF has access, network, and control signal interfaces. The access and network interface are user plane interfaces.
