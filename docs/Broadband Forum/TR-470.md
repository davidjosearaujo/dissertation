# 7 BBF specified Information Elements
## 7.1 Line ID
The format of the Line ID is generic, allowing different operators and access networks to use different encoding of the content. The Line ID has common information (Circuit ID and/or Remote ID), but it can be encoded in different formats.
## 7.2 Global Line Identifier (GLI)
An **operator wide unique identifier of the line connecting the RG** (For both 5G-RG and FN-RG) to the network is mandatory to achieve the usage with 5GC. Therefore, AGF needs to construct a unique identifier in the form of a GLI based on the Line ID.

The BBF specified GLI is required to be unique to the network operator that owns the AGF or FMIF and this operator is also assumed to be the 5GC operator and is subsequently referred to as simply the operator.
## 7.3 User Location Information (ULI)
The 3GPP specifies the User Location Information (ULI) to be used as the location information for both 5G- RG and FN-RG.
## 7.5 SUPI/SUCI for FN-RG
The 3GPP specifies the SUCI and the SUPI encoding for FN-RG. The SUPI for FN-RG specified in TS 23.316, based on operator configuration, can either contain an IMSI or a GLI as defined in clause 7.2.

The mapping between SUCI based on GLI and SUPI based on IMSI is defined in Table 8.6.1.1 in TS 23.316. When the SUPI is based on the GLI, it takes the NAI format `username@realm`.

The SUCI provided by the AGF to the 5G Core Network is always built based on the GLI and it acts as a pseudonym of the SUPI. Therefore, the 5GC performs the mapping per operator configuration from the SUCI based on GLI to a SUPI.
