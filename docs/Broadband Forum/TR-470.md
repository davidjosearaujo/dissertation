# 7 BBF specified Information Elements
## 7.1 Line ID
The format of the Line ID is generic, allowing different operators and access networks to use different encoding of the content. The Line ID has common information (Circuit ID and/or Remote ID), but it can be encoded in different formats.
## 7.2 Global Line Identifier (GLI)
An **operator wide unique identifier of the line connecting the RG** (For both 5G-RG and FN-RG) to the network is mandatory to achieve the usage with 5GC. Therefore, AGF needs to construct a unique identifier in the form of a GLI based on the Line ID.

The BBF specified GLI is required to be unique to the network operator that owns the AGF or FMIF and this operator is also assumed to be the 5GC operator and is subsequently referred to as simply the operator.
## 7.3 User Location Information (ULI)
