# 7 Security for non-3GPP access to the 5G core network

Security for untrusted non-3GPP access to the 5G Core network is achieved by a procedure using IKEv2 as defined in RFC 7296 to set up one or more IPsec ESP security associations. The role of IKE initiator (or client) is taken by the UE, and the role of IKE responder (or server) is taken by the N3IWF.

During this procedure, the AMF delivers a key K_N3IWF to the N3IWF. The AMF derives the key K_N3IWF from the key K_AMF. The key K_N3IWF is then used by UE and N3IWF to complete authentication within IKEv2.

###  7.2.1 Security procedures

This clause specifies how a UE is authenticated to 5G network via an untrusted non-3GPP access network. It uses a vendor-specific EAP method called "EAP-5G", utilizing the "Expanded" EAP type and the existing 3GPP Vendor-Id, registered with IANA under the SMI Private Enterprise Code registry. The "EAP-5G" method is used between the UE and the N3IWF and is utilized for encapsulating NAS messages. If the UE needs to be authenticated by the 3GPP home network, any of the authentication methods as described in clause 6.1.3 can be used. The method is executed between the UE and AUSF as shown below. 

When possible, the UE shall be authenticated by reusing the existing UE NAS security context in AMF.

1. The **UE connects to an untrusted non-3GPP access network** with procedures outside the scope of 3GPP. When the UE decides to attach to 5GC network, **the UE selects an N3IWF** in a 5G PLMN, as described in TS 23.501 clause 6.3.6.
2. The UE proceeds with the **establishment of an IPsec Security Association (SA) with the selected N3IWF** by initiating an IKE initial exchange according to RFC 7296. After step 2 all subsequent IKE messages are encrypted and integrity protected by using the IKE SA established in this step.
3. The UE shall initiate an IKE_AUTH exchange by sending an IKE_AUTH request message. The AUTH payload is not included in the IKE_AUTH request message, which indicates that the IKE_AUTH exchange shall use EAP signalling (in this case EAP-5G signalling). As per the RFC 7296 [25], in the IDi the UE shall set the ID type as ID_KEY-ID in this message and set its value equal to any random number. The UE shall not use its GUTI/SUCI/SUPI as the Id in this step. If the UE is provisioned with the N3IWF root certificate, it shall include the CERTREQ payload within the IKE_AUTH request message to request N3IWF’s certificate.
4. The N3IWF responds with an IKE_AUTH response message which includes the N3IWF identity, the AUTH payload to protect the previous message it sent to the UE (in the IKE_SA_INIT exchange) and an EAP-Request/5G-Start packet. The EAP-Request/5G-Start packet informs the UE to initiate an EAP-5G session, i.e. to start sending NAS messages encapsulated within EAP-5G packets. If the UE has sent a CERTREQ payload in step 3, the N3IWF shall also include the CERT payload including N3IWF certificate.
5. The UE shall validate the N3IWF certificate and shall confirm that the N3IWF identity matches the N3IWF selected by the UE. An absence of the certificate from the N3IWF if the UE had requested the certificate  or unsuccessful identity confirmation shall result in a connection failure. The UE shall send an IKE_AUTH request which includes an EAP-Response/5G-NAS packet that contains a Registration Request message containing UE security capabilities and the SUCI. If UE is already with the 5GC over 3GPP access and there is an available security context, the UE shall integrity protect the Registration Request message and shall send the 5G-GUTI instead of SUCI. The N3IWF shall refrain from sending an EAP-Identity request. The UE may ignore an EAP Identity request or respond with the SUCI it sent in the Registration Request. If the UE has registered to the same AMF through 3GPP access, and if this is the first time that the UE connects to the 5GC through non-3GPP access, the value of corresponding UL NAS COUNT used for integrity protection is 0; else it can use the existing non-3GPP specific UL NAS COUNT for integrity protection

> The N3IWF does not send an EAP-Identity request because the UE includes its identity in the IKE_AUTH request in message 5. This is in line with RFC 7296 [25], clause 3.16. 

6. The N3IWF shall select an AMF as specified in TS 23.501 [2], clause 6.5.3. The N3IWF forwards the Registration Request received from the UE to the AMF.
7. If the AMF receives a 5G-GUTI and the Registration is integrity protected, it may use the security context to verify the integrity protection as describe in clause 6.4.6. If the UE has registered to the same AMF through 3GPP access, and if this is the first time that the AMF receives UE’s NAS signalling through non-3GPP access, the value of corresponding UL NAS COUNT used for integrity verification is 0; else it can use the existing non-3GPP specific UL NAS COUNT for integrity verification. If integrity is verified successfully, this means that UE is authenticated by AMF.If integrity is verified successfully and no newer security context has been activated over the 3GPP access, then s the primary authentication and tep 8 to step 11 may be skipped. If integrity is verified successfully and a newer security context has been activated over the 3GPP access then authentication may be skipped but the AMF shall activate the newer context with a NAS SMC procedure as described in step 8 and onwards. Otherwise, the AMF shall authenticate the UE.
8. The AMF shall send a Security Mode Command (SMC) to the UE in order to activate NAS security associated with NAS connection identifier "0x02". This message is first sent to N3IWF (within an N2 message). If EAP-AKA' is used for authentication, the AMF shall encapsulate the EAP-Success received from AUSF within the SMC message.
