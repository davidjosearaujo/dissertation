# 4.2.8 Support of non-3GPP access

The following types of non-3GPP access networks are defined:
- Untrusted non-3GPP access networks;
- Trusted non-3GPP access networks; and
- Wireline access networks.

## General Concepts

The 5G Core Network supports connectivity of UEs via non-3GPP access networks, e.g. WLAN access networks.

Supports both untrusted non-3GPP access networks and trusted non-3GPP access networks (TNANs).

An **untrusted non-3GPP** access network **shall be connected** to the 5G Core Network **via a Non-3GPP InterWorking Function (N3IWF)**, via **N2** interface .

# 6.2.1 AMF
The Access and Mobility Management function (AMF) includes the following functionality:
- Termination of RAN CP interface (N2)
- Termination of NAS (N1)
- Registration management
- Connection management
- Access Authentication
- Access Authorization

# 6.3.6 N3IWF selection


# 6.2.20 WAGF

[SAGERAN W-AGF Devide](https://www.sageran.com/products/network-equipments/w-agf.html)

W-AGF(Wireline Access Gateway Function ) is a wired access network function node based on 5G technology, defined by 3GPP and BBF. It acts as an intermediary between the RG and UPF, supporting N2 and N3 access to 5GC.

W-AGF is developed on the SageRAN's 5G Engineâ„¢ protocol stack platform and complies with 3GPP standards and the BBF WWC architecture, while adding processing logic for N1(NAS) protocol and SIM card information for network registration.

Additionally, W-AGF includes data routing and forwarding modules for registration and IP data link connections to the 5GC core network, providing standard fixed-mobile convergence network access technology for high-reliability, high-security, and unified authentication.

W-AGF can be widely applied in dedicated network links for industries such as hospitals, banks, campuses, and small and medium enterprises.
