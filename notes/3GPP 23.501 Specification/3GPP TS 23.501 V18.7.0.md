# 4.2.8 Support of non-3GPP access

The following types of non-3GPP access networks are defined:
- Untrusted non-3GPP access networks;
- Trusted non-3GPP access networks; and
- Wireline access networks.

## General Concepts

The 5G Core Network supports connectivity of UEs via non-3GPP access networks, e.g. WLAN access networks.

Supports both untrusted non-3GPP access networks and trusted non-3GPP access networks (TNANs).

An **untrusted non-3GPP** access network **shall be connected** to the 5G Core Network **via a Non-3GPP InterWorking Function (N3IWF)**, via **N2** interface .
