# 5 Converged Architecture with the 3GPP 5G Core


3GPP has identified reference architecture diagrams for the interworking and integration models of convergence; they are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. The following **hybrid fiber-coax (HFC)** network components are portrayed in the 3GPP reference architectures. ***We are only interested in two***
- The W-5GCAN (Wireline 5G Cable Access Network) combines the HFC infrastructure, primarily the cable model termination system (CMTS), with the **W-AGF interworking function**. The W-5GCAN may also include CM initialization servers, PacketCable Multimedia (PCMM) interfaces, and IP address management components.
- The **W-AGF (Wireline Access Gateway Function)**, as identified by 3GPP, is a layer of **interworking capabilities between the HFC network and the 5G mobile core** infrastructure. It is contained within the W-5GCAN.
