Private **cellular networks** are not new, but, as shown in Figure 1, from a current estimate of **about one thousand private networks based on 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)** specified technology, their numbers are expected to grow to 10’s of thousands due to:
- Guaranteed local coverage, enabled by the availability of localized private, unlicensed/ shared spectrum and cost-efficient, cloud-based 4G/5G core deployments;
- Reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) from the elimination of wired and other connectivity (e.g., Wi-Fi);
- Growing demand for enterprise information and data security, associated with localized data processing capabilities for ultra-high-performance applications;
- Search for increased productivity solutions through automation and digitalization of enterprise processes;
- Demand for low latency and reliable services.

# Private 5G networks
In the technical specification related with service requirements for the 5G system [5], 3GPP describes non-public networks (NPN), 3GPP’s terminology for private networks, as being
