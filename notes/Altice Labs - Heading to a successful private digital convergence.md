Private **cellular networks** are not new, but, as shown in Figure 1, from a current estimate of **about one thousand private networks based on 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)** specified technology, their numbers are expected to grow to 10’s of thousands due to:
- Guaranteed local coverage, enabled by the availability of localized private, unlicensed/ shared spectrum and cost-efficient, cloud-based 4G/5G core deployments;
- Reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) from the elimination of wired and other connectivity (e.g., Wi-Fi);
- Growing demand for enterprise information and data security, associated with localized data processing capabilities for ultra-high-performance applications;
- Search for increased productivity solutions through automation and digitalization of enterprise processes;
- Demand for low latency and reliable services.

# Private 5G networks
In the technical specification related with service requirements for the 5G system, 3GPP describes **non-public networks (NPN)**, 3GPP’s terminology for private networks, as being "*intended for the sole use of a private entity
such as an enterprise, and may be deployed in a variety of configurations, utilizing both virtual and physical elements. Specifically, they may be deployed as completely standalone networks, they may be hosted by a **public land mobile network (PLMN)**, or they may be offered as a slice of a PLMN*"

That way, a 5G NPN consists in the usage of a 5G system for private use, being deployed as:
- a **standalone NPN (SNPN**): operated by an NPN operator and not relying on network functions provided by a PLMN, or
- a **public network-integrated NPN (PNI-NPN)**: a non-public network deployed with the support of a PLMN.

As any 5G system, 5G NPN are composed of **user equipments (UE)** - terminals or end-systems -, 5G **accesses** - consisting of **next-generation NodeB (gNB)** units connecting UE via a 5G new radio (5G-NR) wireless interface, **and a 5G core (5GC)**.
