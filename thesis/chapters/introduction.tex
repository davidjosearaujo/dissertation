A short description of the chapter.

\section{Background and Context}

% Introduce 5G as a significant advancement in wireless technology, highlighting its core features such as higher speeds, lower latency, and support for diverse use cases (e.g., enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine-type communications, ultra-reliable low-latency communications).

In recent years, \ac{5G} wireless technology has revolutionized telecommunications. It offers higher bandwidth, faster speeds, and lower delays, supporting use cases like \ac{eMBB}, \ac{mMTC}, and \ac{uRLLC}.

Additionally, it is transforming private networks, which have traditionally relied on legacy wired or wireless (WLAN) Ethernet. Features like tighter security, higher reliability, and \ac{TSN} are crucial to meeting Industry 4.0 requirements for wireless connectivity. However, how can the industry bridge the gap between existing \ac{N5GC} devices, which current networks rely on, and new \acp{5GC}?

\subsection{5G Architecture}

% Briefly describe the Service Based Architecture of 5G, emphasizing the incorporation of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN).
% Mention the various access nodes supported by the 5G system, including native 5G-NR and LTE accesses, and non-3GPP interworking functions.

5G is not only a revolution in radio network infrastructure but also in the core network. Now based on Service Based Architecture, using \ac{NFV} and \ac{SDN}, it allows it to minimize cost and maximize utilization and elasticity of the infrastructure by seperating the \ac{UP} functions from the \ac{CP} function. This architecture supports various access nodes such as native 5G New Radio (NR), LTE accesses, and non-3GPP interworking functions that facilitate connectivity from untrusted WLANs.~\cite{23.501}

\subsection{Convergence with Wi-Fi}

% Discuss the importance of integrating Wi-Fi networks with 5G to enhance connectivity options for users and devices.
% Highlight the challenges posed by current standards that do not support Wi-Fi-only devices without USIM in connecting to the 5G Core.

As wireless networks evolve, the convergence of 5G with existing Wi-Fi infrastructures becomes increasingly critical. However, current standards established by the \ac{3GPP} do not adequately address the integration of Wi-Fi-only devices that lack Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) capabilities into the 5G core network. This limitation is particularly evident in enterprise environments where many devices operate solely on Wi-Fi.~\cite{wba042021}

\section{Problem Statement}

% - Highlight that the current 3GPP standard does not define an architecture to support Wi-Fi-only devices without USIM connecting to the 5G Core.
% - Emphasize the importance of this issue, especially in enterprise deployments where many devices lack USIM capabilities.
% - Mention the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA) recommendation for 3GPP to define procedures for supporting Wi-Fi-only UE with non-IMSI based identity and EAP-TLS/EAP-TTLS based authentication.

\section{Research Objectives}

% - State your primary goal: to explore and develop solutions for integrating Wi-Fi-only devices without USIM into the 5G Core infrastructure.
% - List specific objectives, such as:
%   - Investigating authentication mechanisms compatible with both 5G and Wi-Fi networks.
%   - Developing a method for device identification that works across 5G and non-3GPP networks.
%   - Proposing extensions or alternatives to existing protocols to support seamless integration.

\section{Significance of the Study}

% - Explain the importance of solving this integration challenge for the future of wireless communications.
% - Discuss potential applications and benefits in various sectors, such as enterprise networks, IoT deployments, and smart city initiatives.

\section{Thesis Structure}

% - Provide a brief overview of the subsequent chapters and their contents.
